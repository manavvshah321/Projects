# Projects

Over the 4 years of my undergraduate education at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, I have got the opportunity to lean various softwares and utilize them for interesting projects. The projects listed here some projects that I've worked on for courses and some individually. Here, I aim to give a short introduction on each project and it's purpose.

### ISyE 350: Junior Design Lab

This course was a semester long project where we had to meet our mock client, WiScooter's, requirements. WiScooter was experiencing rapid demand for 3 stock-keeping-units (SKU's) and didn't have the capacity to meet those demands for the next 10 years. Our team was tasked with creating a report that provided WiScooter a detailed evaluation on how to increase their production capacity at their manufacturing facility and move finished goods inventory to a nearby warehouse. During the course of this project, we were able to create Gantt Charts, Aggregate Resource Tables, Value Stream Maps and more and provide basis for our evaluations by performing MOST Analysis, Inventory & Capacity Analysis, Pugh Matrix and many more.

### ISyE 312: Data Management and Analysis for Industrial Engineers

For this project, our team investigated the relationship between various health factors and resting blood pressure. We started the project by explore the dataset of over 300 individuals and checking to see what types of data exist in the dataset and if there is any basis to run a simple linear regression model. We followed this by succesfully running a simple linear regression model and analyze the outcome which led us to run a multiple linear regression model to explain the low R-squared value. To confirm our analysis, we created a scatterplot matrix and checked for influential variables by using Cook's Distance. Finally, we provided an alternative suggestion to model which utilized Enhanced Regression and provided further recommedations to make our model better, if it were to be worked on by another team.

### ISyE 315: Production Planning and Control

The course project for Production Planning and Control was extremely interesting! Our group was tasked with 2 goals to achieve for our mock client, Tomahawk Metals: to keep welding outsourced or move it in-house and to create an efficient production layout for the shop floor that will allow Tomahawk Metals to meet their demand for the next 10 years. To achieve our goals, we utliized Payback & Financial Analysis, Sensitivity Analysis and Relationship Flow Diagrams to generate conclusive recommendations for Tomahawk Metals.

### ISyE 320: Simulation and Probabilistic Modeling

Our course project for Simulation and Probabilistic Modeling allowed us to use a simulation software, Arena, and statistical analysis to explore a solution that improves the traffic flow of a roundbout in Waunakee, Wisconsin. We conducted input, output and sensitivity analysis to guage how the current system works and calculated the arrival and interarrival times of the vehicles. Furthermore, we observed which distributions the vehicle arrving from each of the 4 entry points follows, such as Lognormal, Beta and Weibull distribution. We simulated the system in Arena and observed which changes to the rounabout would improve the traffic flow. We arrived at the final solution to add an additional lane and the conducted a cost-benefit analysis to check its feasibility.
