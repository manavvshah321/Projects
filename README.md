# Projects

Over the 4 years of my undergraduate education at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, I have got the opportunity to lean various softwares and utilize them for interesting projects. The projects listed here some projects that I've worked on for courses and some individually. Here, I aim to give a short introduction on each project and it's purpose.

### ISyE 350: Junior Design Lab

This course was a semester long project where we had to meet our mock client, WiScooter's, requirements. WiScooter was experiencing rapid demand for 3 stock-keeping-units (SKU's) and didn't have the capacity to meet those demands for the next 10 years. Our team was tasked with creating a report that provided WiScooter a detailed evaluation on how to increase their production capacity at their manufacturing facility and move finished goods inventory to a nearby warehouse. During the course of this project, we were able to create Gantt Charts, Aggregate Resource Tables, Value Stream Maps and more and provide basis for our evaluations by performing MOST Analysis, Inventory & Capacity Analysis, Pugh Matrix and many more.

### ISyE 312: Data Management and Analysis for Industrial Engineers

For this project, our team investigated the relationship between various health factors and resting blood pressure. We started the project by explore the dataset of over 300 individuals and checking to see what types of data exist in the dataset and if there is any basis to run a simple linear regression model. We followed this by succesfully running a simple linear regression model and analyze the outcome which led us to run a multiple linear regression model to explain the low R-squared value. To confirm our analysis, we created a scatterplot matrix and checked for influential variables by using Cook's Distance. Finally, we provided an alternative suggestion to model which utilized Enhanced Regression and provided further recommedations to make our model better, if it were to be worked on by another team.

### ISyE 315: Production Planning and Control

The course project for Production Planning and Control was extremely interesting! Our group was tasked with 2 goals to achieve for our mock client, Tomahawk Metals: to keep welding outsourced or move it in-house and to create an efficient production layout for the shop floor that will allow Tomahawk Metals to meet their demand for the next 10 years. To achieve our goals, we utliized Payback & Financial Analysis, Sensitivity Analysis and Relationship Flow Diagrams to generate conclusive recommendations for Tomahawk Metals.

### ISyE 320: Simulation and Probabilistic Modeling

Our course project for Simulation and Probabilistic Modeling allowed us to use a simulation software, Arena, and statistical analysis to explore a solution that improves the traffic flow of a roundbout in Waunakee, Wisconsin. We conducted input, output and sensitivity analysis to guage how the current system works and calculated the arrival and interarrival times of the vehicles. Furthermore, we observed which distributions the vehicle arrving from each of the 4 entry points follows, such as Lognormal, Beta and Weibull distribution. We simulated the system in Arena and observed which changes to the rounabout would improve the traffic flow. We arrived at the final solution to add an additional lane and the conducted a cost-benefit analysis to check its feasibility.

### ISyE 412: Fundamentals of Industrial Data Analytics

ISyE 412 allowed us to expereince Tableau for the first time. I worked with a group of 3 to create an interactive Tableau dashboard that reflected our findings from our project. For our project, we chose to investigate the relationship between credit card approval and discrimination. A machine learning algorithm predicts an applicants credit card approval rate by making connections between hundreds of data points. We dived deeper into these connections and explored if there were any underlying or unintentional biases created by the algorithm that may deny a suitable applicant the chance for a credit card based on discriminatory factors.

### ISyE 323: Operations Research - Deterministic Modeling

ISyE 323 was my first step into operations research and optimization. During this class we learned all about the basics of optimzation and equipped ourselves with Julia. We ended the semseter with a project where we had to choose any problem that could be optimized. Having a motivated interest in football (soccer), I created a optiimization algorithm to pick the best fantasy team given certain constraints such as budget, maximum of 3 players from the same team, 1 goal keeper and their points. This project allowed me to leverage my interests into an academic project that I enjoyed. Learning Julia was a challenging yet satisfying task, as I was able to get a good understanding of the language and am now able to model different types of problems.

### ISyE 524: Introduction to Optimization

While imersing myself into the world of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, I decided to take a high level optimization class at UW - Madison. CS 524: Introduction to Optimization gave me the opportunity to learn about all the concepts of optimization in depth. We got the opportunity to learn about topics such as convexity and backglogging, minimax, duality, piecewise linear functions and stochastic programming. While this course was challenging, it contained a reserve knowledge. We ended the semester with a final individual project that was 30% of our grade. Since, I was taking ISyE 323: Operations Research - Deterministic Modeling during the same term as this class, I decided to use the same topic for both projects. Doing this, allowed me to look at the same problem in 2 different programming languages. I was able to build upon the basic model in Julia (ISyE 323), and made an interactive application using GAMS/MIRO (ISyE 524). In the project, I created an optimization model to pick the best fantasy soccer team based on certain constraints. Additionally, I made the application interactive, wherein you could change the budget of the players or the number of attackers, defenders or midfielders.
