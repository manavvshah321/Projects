# Projects

Over the 4 years of my undergraduate education at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, I have got the opportunity to lean various softwares and utilize them for interesting projects. The projects listed here some projects that I've worked on for courses and some individually. Here, I aim to give a short introduction on each project and it's purpose.

### ISyE 350: Junior Design Lab

This course was a semester long project, where we had to meet our mock client, WiScooter's requirements. WiScooter was experiencing rapid demand for 3 stock-keeping-units (SKU's) and didn't have the capacity to meet those demands for the next 10 years. Our team was tasked with creating a report that provided WiScooter a detailed evaluation on how to increase their production capacity at their manufacturing facility and move finished goods inventory to a nearby warehouse. During the course of this project, we were able to create Gantt Charts, Aggregate Resource Tables, Value Stream Maps and more and provide basis for our evaluations by performing MOST Analysis, Inventory & Capacity Analysis, Pugh Matrix and many more.
